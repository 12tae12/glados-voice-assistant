# GLaDOS Voice Assistant
DIY Voice Assistant based on the GLaDOS character from Portal video game series.

* Designed for Raspberry Pi
* Written mostly in Python
* Work in progress

[Check out the GLaDOS Voice Assistant project on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23glados)%20(from%3Anerdaxic)&src=typed_query)

## Main features
1. Local Trigger word detection using PocketSphinx
2. Speech to text processing using Google's API (for now)
3. GLaDOS Text-to-Speech generation using https://glados.c-net.org/
4. Storeing of generated audio samples locally for instant answers in the future
5. Animatronic eye control using servos
5. Round LCD for an eye to display display textures

Tight integration with Home Assistant's local API:
* Send commands to Home Assistant
* Can read and speak sensor data
* Notification API, so Home Assistant can speak notifications aloud
