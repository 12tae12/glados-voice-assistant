### ðŸ›  [Check out the GLaDOS Voice Assistant project on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23glados)%20(from%3Anerdaxic)&src=typed_query)

## Main features
1. Local Trigger word detection using PocketSphinx
2. Speech to text processing using Google's API (for now)
3. GLaDOS Text-to-Speech generation using https://glados.c-net.org/
4. Storing of generated audio samples locally for instant answers in the future
5. Animatronic eye control using servos
5. Round LCD for an eye to display display textures

Tight integration with Home Assistant's local API:
* Send commands to Home Assistant
* Can read and speak sensor data
* Notification API, so Home Assistant can speak notifications aloud

## What it can do:
* Clock
* Control lights and devices
* Weather and forecast
* Add things to shopping list
* Read sensor information
* Random magic 8-ball answers
* Tell jokes
* Judge you and be mean
* Advanced fat-shaming
* Log stuff and gather training data locally

## To use:
You can add glados.py to your crontab file or run it manually.
``` 
crontab -e
@reboot python3 /home/username/GLaDOS-Voice-Assistant/glados.py
``` 
Additionally you can configure the ReSpeaker at startup by adding following lines to root's crontab:
``` 
sudo su
crontab -e
@reboot bash /home/username/GLaDOS-Voice-Assistant/hardware/ReSpeaker/ReSpeaker_Startup_Config.sh
@reboot python3 /home/username/GLaDOS-Voice-Assistant/hardware/ReSpeaker/ReSpeaker_Turn_off_Pixelring.py
```
